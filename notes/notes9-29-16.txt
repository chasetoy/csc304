sorting and searching (continued)

collision and collision resolution
-----------------------------------

open addressing and separate chaining


deleting from a hash table
---------------------------
1.) for separate chaining, it is just a deletion from a list.
2.) for any open addressing techniques, you must repair every probe sequence
the key happens to be a part of.

Primary and Secondary Clustering
---------------------------------
1.) primray clustering occurs when many keys hash to the same address.


2.) seconday clustering occurs when probe sequences merge in other ways.
