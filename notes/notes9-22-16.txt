best case, worst case, and average case analysis:

best case : matches on the first case
worst case : matches on the last case, n number of loops
average case : finds half way through, n/2 number of loops

Some Algorithm Classifications:

1. Precise
2. Heuristic
3. Brute-Force
4. Greedy

*maybe some half assed python code*

*i was right it was handwritten sudo code that was useless*
