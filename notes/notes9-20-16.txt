recursion:
	when is it okay for a function to call itself? Does it ever make sense?

alg sum(L):
	let n = the number of elements of L
	if L is empty, return zero
	else:
		let x be the first element of L
		let remainder be the last n-1 elements of L
		return x+Sum(remainder)

def sqrt(a):
	if a < 0 : raise ComplexRootException
	approx = a/2
	return approxsqrt(a, approx, le-12)

def approxsqrt(a, guess, eps):
	if abs(A - guess * guess) < eps: return guess
	else:
		guess = (guess + a/guess)/2
		return approxsqrt(a, guess, eps)
